HTML is HyperText Markup Language and CSS is Cascading Style Sheets.
For declaring elements, we always use HTML.
For styling the elements we've declared with HTML we use CSS.
HTML tag is the beggining and the end of an elements. (<>, </>)
The 3 parts of an HTML element are the two tags(opening and closing) and the content within them.
Doctype is use for letting the browser know what version of HTML we will run and render.
It is the root element of our documnent, meaning it's the parent element of all others.
The head element is where we put meta tags that are vital for our rendering of the homepage and it's functions.
The Body elements is where everything we want a user to see is declared.
We create a paragraph with: <p> </p>
We create heading with: <h> </h>.
There are 6 levels of headings (<H1> --> <H6>) and it goes from H1 having the biggest font too H6 having the smallest.
<b> for bold text and <strong> for imnportant.
<i> for italic and <em> for emphasized.
The upper level element is the parent element to the nested one. Meaning the nested element, as a child, can "inherit: properties.
Both elements are children to a parent element.
You create a comment by writing: <! –– and the comment closes with ––>
You write: <ul> for an Unordered list.
You write: <ol> for an ordered list.
You write: <li> inside an <ol> or <ul> element to create a list.
You write: <a href = "target-link"> What the link displays </a>.
Atrributes are what is used to adjust the behavior and looks of elements. For instance font-size, color etc.
The attribute that "tells" the link where to go is the: href = "".
An absolute link has all the necessary information needed for the maschine to find the link, while a relative link is a starting point for the maschine to find the link specified.
The element used to display an image element is: <img>.
<img> elements always need to have an src = "" attribute and an alt = "" attribute.
By specifying the route with the src = "./folder/.../target-location or ../folder/..../target-location" or href = "". Depending on the level the first folder is located we need one or two dots.
The four main formats used by images on the web are: PNG, JPG, GIF and SVG.
